              Enterprise sales isn't about persuading someone to buy; it's about understanding their goals and helping them move through complexity with confidence. I treat sales as a profession, a craft that blends insight, preparation, and trust-building. I don't just run a sales process; I support a buying process. My goal is to be useful, not just persistent, and to be the kind of person customers want to hear from because I add value, not pressure.
