                    I'm driven by more than just hitting targets, I want to build a career that balances success with meaning. Outside of work, I'm a dad and partner first, which keeps me grounded and focused on what truly matters. That sense of responsibility and empathy informs how I lead conversations, build relationships, and support customers and teammates alike.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I believe in continuous growth, not just professionally but personally. Whether it's staying active, exploring new music, or diving into psychology and nutrition, I bring that same curiosity and energy into every part of my life. This balance helps me stay resilient and adaptable in the fast-paced world of enterprise software sales.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ultimately, I'm here to create lasting impact, not only in deals closed but in trust earned and value delivered over time.
